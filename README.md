![](bands.png)

This script calculates transition energies between energy bands using eigen-
energy files generated by ABINIT during a band structure calculation. This
script allows you to input a desired energy value and finds all the upward
transitions that can produce that value within a specified tolerance.

If the input file is an unformatted EIG file produced by ABINIT, you can use
the adjoining 'eigenconvert.py' program that will automatically format it to a
plottable file. You can then use that file to calculate the transitions.
You can generate the sample output with 

```
./pynergy.py -i sample_EIG -v 3 -e 6.81
```

A good gnuplot arrow style can be

```
set style arrow 3 head linetype 1 linecolor rgb "#000" linewidth 1.5 size screen 0.01,7,90
```
